# Clock Face Detection

## What is this

This is a small program I created at university for a course on image processing.

It opens images and tries to find clock faces in them.

Note that this is quite old code, and while the ideas in it are sound, the implementation can be improved a lot. Don't use it as a reference in that sense.
